- output the changelog as markdown when asked.
- git tags are used to mark the commit that cut a new release of the gem
- the gem version is located in [version.rb](mdc:lib/mcp/version.rb)
- use the git history, especially merge commits from PRs to construct the changelog
- when necessary, look at the diff of files changed to determine whether a PR should be listed in
  - ## Added; adds new functionality
  - ## Changed; alters functionality; especially backward compatible changes
  - ## Fixed; bugfixes that are forward compatible

use the following format for changelogs:

```
## Added
- New functionality added that was not present before

## Changed
- Alterations to functionality that may indicate breaking changes

## Fixed
- Bug fixes
